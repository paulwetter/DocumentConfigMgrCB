ConfigMgr
=========

This is a nearly full rewrite of the System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) documentation script so kindly shared with everyone by David O'Brien (@davidobrien1985, Twitter:@david_obrien).

I am attempting to document most everything in Current Branch.

The requirement for Microsoft Word has been dropped in favor of a pure formatted HTML output.

Please submit issues if you find a bug or have ideas on additional data that should be collected.

<b>Note:</b>  This has not been tested against an environment with a CAS or secondary sites.  But, most of us should not be running a CAS or secondary site in the age of Current Branch.

My updated script contains pretty much everything collected from the original.  Below is a summary of what’s New:  
  *	Removed dependence on Microsoft Word.  
  *	Formatted HTML output.  
  *	Updated to work with Current Branch (1710+).  
  *	Collects everything for Software Updates (ADRS, Config, Packages, Groups)!!  
  *	Collects important Info for SQL database.  
  *	Collects Site features and servicing history.  
  *	Collect Default Boundary Group settings.  
  *	Extended to include configuration of all the new Client Settings.  
  *	Collects additional Collection information.  
  *	Summarizes Collections with maintenance windows.  
  *	Summary of all the different Compliance settings (Conditional Access, Company resources, etc).  
  *	Updated Endpoint Protection Profile info.  
  *	MUCH more detail on Applications.  
  *	Added OSD Related Items (Installers, Images, Upgrade Packages)

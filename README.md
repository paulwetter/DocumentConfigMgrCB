ConfigMgr
=========

This is a nearly full rewrite of the System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) documentation script so kindly shared with everyone by David O'Brien (@davidobrien1985, Twitter:@david_obrien).

I am attempting to document most everything in Current Branch.

The requirement for Microsoft Word has been dropped in favor of a pure HTML output.

Please submit issues if you find bug or have ideas on additional data that should be collected.

My updated script contains pretty much everything collected from the original.  Below is a summary of what’s New:
  •	Removed dependence on Microsoft Word.
  •	Formatted HTML output.
  •	Updated to work with Current Branch (1710+).
  •	Collects everything for Software Updates (ADRS, Config, Packages, Groups)!!
  •	Collects important Info for SQL database.
  •	Collects Site features and servicing history.
  •	Collect Default Boundary Group settings.
  •	Extended to include configuration of all the new Client Settings.
  •	Collects additional Collection information.
  •	Summarizes Collections with maintenance windows.
  •	Summary of all the different Compliance settings (Conditional Access, Company resources, etc).
  •	Updated Endpoint Protection Profile info.
  •	MUCH more detail on Applications.
  •	Added OSD Related Items (Installers, Images, Upgrade Packages)
  •	Lists Task Sequence steps.
  •	Summary or detailed options.
  •	CM Scripts
